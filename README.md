## Installation

On macOS, run this:

```sh
pip install -U cider
git clone --recursive https://github.com/msanders/dotfiles ~/.cider
cider restore
```

This will symlink the appropriate files to your home directory. Everything is
configured and tweaked within `~/.cider`.

On Linux, after cloning instead run `scripts/linux_setup.sh`.
